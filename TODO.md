# TODO

- improve exit_fn syntax
- make exit a built-in function instead of using valk:os:exit()
- infer property type from default value
- `construct new() {}` instead of `static fn new() {}`
-- This forces the use of the use of `new()` to create an object of that class (multiple constructors allowed)
